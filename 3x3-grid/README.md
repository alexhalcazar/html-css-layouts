# 3x3 Grid Layout (Flex and Non-Flex)

This project implements a centered 3x3 red square layout using two different approaches to reinforce my understanding of document flow, CSS layout models, and centering techniques.

## Goals

-   Practice traditional block-level element positioning
-   Learn and apply Flexbox for layout control
-   Understand how HTML and CSS behave with minimal styling
