# HTML & CSS Layouts Projects

This repository contains a series of small layout-focused HTML/CSS projects to strengthen my frontend skills and build muscle memory with layouts like Flexbox, Grid, and responsive design.

## Projects

-Pricing Page (in progress)

Each project is self-contained in its own folder with an `index.html`, `style.css`, and its own README.
